## How to Play 🎮

1. **Start the Game:** The computer generates a secret number with non-repeating digits. 🔢
2. **Make a Guess:** Enter a number with the same number of digits. 💡
3. **Receive Feedback:**
    *   🐂 **Bulls:** Correct digits in the correct position.
    *   🐄 **Cows:** Correct digits but in the wrong position.
4. **Strategize:** Use the feedback to refine your next guess. 🧐
5. **Win:** Keep guessing until you match the secret number exactly. 🏆
